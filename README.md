Find the length of a string  by adding .lenght after the string variable
eg;
var firstName = "Jordne";
var firstNameLength;
firstNameLength = firstName.length;

Bracket notation is used to get a character at a specific index.
Starting to count from zero rather than at one is called zero-based indexing.
eg;
var firstName= "Jordne"
var firstLetter = firstName[0];

String values in JS are immutable. You can change the entire string but not the string values.
